// // Wordle

// X - 5 x 5 squares deal aka the gameboard
//     X - create blank spaces to type in letters
//     X - allow for editing guess if typo

// X - make ajax request for the word?

// X - have a button to submit their guess

// - indicator of correct letter placement
// - indicator of letter in word but not correct placement

// X - using ajax to submit guess and check if correct

// TODO - Next Steps
// - at the bottom of the js File, add event listeners to the other forms (guess-2, guess-3),
//     - you can use the first one as a model

// - figure out how you'd like to display correct guessed letters/incorrect guesses/indicators

// - what happens when the user gets it right? do they get a new word?
